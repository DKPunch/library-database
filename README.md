# library-database

This program was the final assignment for my first term of Computer Science.
The program reads a text file containing book titles and authors and stores 
the data into memory. The assignment required that we use a little bit of 
everything that we learned over the term. Including the usage of an array of 
structs, reading text files into the arrays, implementing a search function 
and also adding a method of sorting the data that is displayed. An example
text file (library.txt) has been uploaded for optimal use with the program.
